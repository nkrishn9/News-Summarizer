# News Summarizer #

This is an android application that summarizes news articles. It uses the [Sentisum API](https://sentisum.3scale.net/) for the text processing, so it's essentially guaranteed to scale poorly (I think I only get 50 API calls a day). 

Nevertheless, it is a fun little app that uses a NLP REST API to do someting pretty neat.
